### Notes 

1. Render means updating something in dom.
2. React.createElement gives us the object and then that object is rendered into an HTML DOM. Then object is converted to HTML(DOM)
React.createElement=>Object=>HTML(DOM) 
3. React???
because we want to update our HTML using JS.
4. JSX is HTML inside JS[ that is wrong ] Jsx is html like syntax inside JS.
5. React uses key to uniquely identify an element.
6. Babel as black box we can think as it takes a piece of code and gives us back the other code in normal form.[Compilier it will read code line by line  ]
7. JSX uses react.creatElement
 JSX=>React.creatElement=>Object=>HTML(DOM)
 BABEL convert JSX to React.createlement
 it also removes ur console.log
8. One tag is know as react element.
9. Functional Component is nothing but just a function which return a JSX or reactElement or compositon of react.
10. Name of component always start with Capital Letter. Not mandatory but good practice.
Function component is normal function that is returning some JSX,react element.
11.  Components are independent and reusable bits of code.
12.   what is difference between react element and react component?
 root.render(heading);
 root.render(<Heading/>)

 13. We can put any JS inside our functional Component within {} curly braces.
 14. If we want to use component inside  component then it is know as component composition(composing component).

15. const element = <div>
  <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <h2>Good to see you here.</h2>
</div>
we can have multi line elements in the variable.
