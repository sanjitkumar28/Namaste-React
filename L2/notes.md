###
1. npm--> package(modules) manager for JS 
similarly yarn is also a package manager

2. package.json--> metadata about the project

### Package.lock.json is very important file we don't want to keep it in git ignore. It locks version of the package for us. Otherwise it will lead to problems that it is working in my local environment but not working in production environment. It is mantaining the the version of each package present in the node modules directory.
3. Node modules are like the database for our npm.

4. npm i react and npm install react are same.

5. NPX: The npx stands for Node Package Execute and it comes with the npm, when you installed npm above 5.2.0 version then automatically npx will installed. It is an npm package runner that can execute any package that you want from the npm registry without even installing that package. The npx is useful during a single time use package.

6. Hot Module Reloading: Hot reloading. As you make changes to your code, Parcel automatically rebuilds the changed files and updates your app in the browser
