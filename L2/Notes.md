### Lecture 2 Notes

1. Anything which we can generate in server can be put in gitignore.
2. React alone does not make web app fast itself but with it there are many things like parcel and etc which makes web app faster. Orchestration 
3. Transitive dependecies where one package depends on other and that other package depends on another package. so it's like an dependency tree.
4. /dist folder contains dev build for a project 
5. Parcel and webpack are the bundlers used mostly for JavaScript or Typescript code that helps you to minify, clean, and make your code compact so that it becomes easier to send a request or receive the response from the server when it usually takes you to transfer multiple files without using any bundler for loading the page of your application
6. package.json is just a configuration file used by npm to manage dependency.
